 *
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * libBigWig is a C library for parsing local/remote bigWig and bigBed files. This is similar to Kent's library from UCSC, except 
 *  * The license is much more liberal
 *  * This code doesn't call `exit()` on error, thereby killing the calling application.
 *
 * External files are accessed using [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/).
 *
 * Please submit issues and pull requests [here](https://github.com/dpryan79/libBigWig).
 *
 * \section Compilation
 *
 * Assuming you already have the curl libraries installed (not just the curl binary!):
 *
 *     make install prefix=/some/path
 *
 * \section Writing bigWig files
 *
 * There are three methods for storing values in a bigWig file, further described in the [wiggle format](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/wiggle.html). The entries within the file are grouped into "blocks" and each such block is limited to storing entries of a single type. So, it is unwise to use a single bedGraph-like endtry followed by a single fixed-step entry followed by a variable-step entry, as that would require three separate blocks, with additional space required for each.
 *
 * \section Testing file types
 *
 * As of version 0.3.0, libBigWig supports reading bigBed files. If an application needs to support both bigBed and bigWig input, then the `bwIsBigWig` and `bbIsBigBed` functions can be used to determine the file type. These both use the "magic" number at the beginning of the file to determine the file type.
 *
 * \section Interval and entry iterators
 *
 * As of version 0.3.0, libBigWig supports iterating over intervals in bigWig files and entries in bigBed files. The number of intervals/entries returned with each iteration can be controlled by setting the number of blocks processed in each iteration (intervals and entries are group inside of bigWig and bigBed files into blocks of entries). See `test/testIterator.c` for an example.
 *
 * \section Examples
 * 
 * Please see [README.md](README.md) and the files under `test/` for examples.

 *
 * These are the functions and structured that should be used by external users. While I don't particularly recommend dealing with some of the structures (e.g., a bigWigHdr_t), they're described here in case you need them.
 *
 * BTW, this library doesn't switch endianness as appropriate, since I kind of assume that there's only one type produced these days.
